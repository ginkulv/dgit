# dgit database VCS (kind of)

A small application written in Rust as a learning exercise for controlling versions of a Database.

Right now it works (apparently it doesn't) only with `PostgreSQL`.

What is expected to be in there:
* `init` repository
* `add` current condition of DB
* `commit` changes
* `push` them to a remote repository
